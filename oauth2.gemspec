(minor) ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES ‚ö†Ô∏è when upgrading from < v2
‚Ä¢ Summary of breaking changes: #{gl_homepage}#what-is-new-for-v20
‚Ä¢ Changes in this patch: #{gl_homepage}/-/blob/v#{gem_version}/CHANGELOG.md#2015-2025-09-08

News:
1. New documentation website, including for OAuth 2.1 and OIDC: https://oauth2.galtzo.com
2. New official Discord for discussion and support: https://discord.gg/3qme4XHNKN
3. New org name "ruby-oauth" on Open Source Collective, GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg (update git remotes!)
4. Non-commercial support for the 2.x series will end by April, 2026. Please make a plan to upgrade to the next version prior to that date.
Support will be dropped for Ruby 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1 and any other Ruby versions which will also have reached EOL by then.
5. Gem releases are cryptographically signed with a 20-year cert; SHA-256 & SHA-512 checksums by stone_checksums.
6. Please consider supporting this project:

  # NOTE: It is preferable to list development dependencies in the gemspec due to increased
  #       visibility and discoverability on RubyGems.org.
  #       However, development dependencies in gemspec will install on
  #       all versions of Ruby that will run in CI.
  #       This gem, and its gemspec runtime dependencies, will install on Ruby down to 2.2.x.
  #       This gem, and its gemspec development dependencies, will install on Ruby down to 2.3.x.
  #       This is because in CI easy installation of Ruby, via setup-ruby, is for >= 2.3.
  #       Thus, dev dependencies in gemspec must have
  #
  #       required_ruby_version ">= 2.3" (or lower)
  #
  #       Development dependencies that require strictly newer Ruby versions should be in a "gemfile",
  #       and preferably a modular one (see gemfiles/modular/*.gemfile).

  spec.add_development_dependency("addressable", "~> 2.8", ">= 2.8.7")  # ruby >= 2.2

  # Git integration (optional)
  # The 'git' gem is optional; oauth2 falls back to shelling out to `git` if it is not present.
  # The current release of the git gem depends on activesupport, which makes it too heavy to depend on directly
  # spec.add_dependency("git", ">= 1.19.1")                               # ruby >= 2.3

  # Development tasks
  # The cake is a lie. erb v2.2, the oldest release on RubyGems.org, was never compatible with Ruby 2.3.
  # This means we have no choice but to use the erb that shipped with Ruby 2.3
  # /opt/hostedtoolcache/Ruby/2.3.8/x64/lib/ruby/gems/2.3.0/gems/erb-2.2.2/lib/erb.rb:670:in `prepare_trim_mode': undefined method `match?' for "-":String (NoMethodError)
  # spec.add_development_dependency("erb", ">= 2.2")                                  # ruby >= 2.3.0, not SemVer, old rubies get dropped in a patch.
  spec.add_development_dependency("gitmoji-regex", "~> 1.0", ">= 1.0.3")            # ruby >= 2.3.0

  # HTTP recording for deterministic specs
  # Ruby 2.3 / 2.4 can fail with:
  # | An error occurred while loading spec_helper.
  # | Failure/Error: require "vcr"
  # |
  # | NoMethodError:

  # So that's why we need backports.
  spec.add_development_dependency("backports", "~> 3.25", ">= 3.25.1")  # ruby >= 0
  # In Ruby 3.5 (HEAD) the CGI library has been pared down, so we also need to depend on gem "cgi" for ruby@head
  # This is done in the "head" appraisal.
  # See: https://github.com/vcr/vcr/issues/1057
  spec.add_development_dependency("vcr", ">= 4")                        # 6.0 claims to support ruby >= 2.3, but fails on ruby 2.4
